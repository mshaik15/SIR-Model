# SIR-Model Overview
This project demonstrates the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model applied to a hypothetical epidemiological scenario. It was created to explore data analysis, modeling, and visualization techniques using Python for educational purposes. 

I am not an epidemiologist, and this analysis is not meant to provide professional or real-world insights into disease spread. The results and visualizations are purely hypothetical and meant to showcase technical and coding skills.
