# SIR-Model Overview
This project demonstrates the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model applied to a hypothetical epidemiological scenario. It was created to explore data analysis, modelling, and visualization techniques using Python for educational purposes. 

I am not an epidemiologist, and this analysis is not meant to provide professional or real-world insights into disease spread. The results and visualizations are purely hypothetical and meant to showcase technical and coding skills.

The dataset is available in "US Measles Cases and Deaths (OWID, 2017)" or https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/blob/master/datasets/US%20Measles%20Cases%20and%20Deaths%20(OWID%2C%202017)/US%20Measles%20Cases%20and%20Deaths%20(OWID%2C%202017).csv 

Refer to the "SIR Predictive Analysis Project Description" for more information on data and implementation
